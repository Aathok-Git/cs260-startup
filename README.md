# Wordle With Friends!

[My Notes](notes.md)

This website will allow a user to create a login, and to submit their wordle score once per day (local time) and be able to compare their scores with other people of their choosing. By inputting the username of another person, they will be able to see them on their "friends list" and be able to compare scores with them. The website will automatically check with the worldle website (hopefully) and confirm that the user is submitting the correct day's wordle. The friends list display will show the score of their friends only after the user has submitted their own score, and will show their score for the day, as well as their average score for all scores submitted.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

This website will provide a means for individuals to submit their daily Wordle scores and compare them to the scores of their friends. The website will show a daily scoreboard of the wordle for the day, as well as a scoreboard of the average score for the account.

```

### Key features

- Will have a login page and will save the login
- Will allow a users to submit a score once per day in local time (if I can't figure out a local time, I'll say when the leaderboard resets)
- Allow users to friend others and the website will display the friends' scores.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Website page with a login page, a submit page, and a scoreboard page. Login and submit will take
- **CSS** - Default dark mode, pretty buttons, etc.
- **React** - Button to add a friend to their leaderboard list
- **Service** - login authentication, save scores and calculate average, check w/ the wordle website to determine when to allow users to submit the next day's score.
- **DB/Login** - account and login, username will be accessed by others to add to friends list.
